<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

By participating in this Challenge, participants agree to be bound by these Challenge Terms and Conditions as well as all decisions of the judges and Expedia which are final and binding on all aspects of the Challenge.</p>

<p>By participating in this Challenge, you acknowledge and agree that if you share an idea, suggestion, or discuss an application concept that you are working on that Expedia and others may use your idea, suggestion or concept and incorporate into an application that they are working on now or in the future, and you waive any and all claims that you may have against Expedia or anyone participating in this Challenge and Expedia may use or incorporate into an application or other service or product, any idea, suggestion, or concept that you mention.</p>

Subject to all applicable laws.</p>

<p><strong>How to Participate:</strong> Participants compete individually or in teams of up to 4 individuals. During the Challenge Period, each individual/team will have the opportunity to hack and build on any of the API’s provided by Expedia via the Challenge website made available at the Event by Expedia (each, a “Submission”). Teams wishing to be considered for the Challenge will be required to complete all relevant Challenge submission forms provided by Expedia. Limit of one (1) Submission per individual/team throughout the Challenge Period.</p>

<p><strong>Judging Criteria:</strong> Submissions will be judged by a panel of external judges (not employed by Expedia) who will review Submissions and select award recipients based upon the following criteria: </p>

<p>Implementation Completeness (working code trumps over fancy PowerPoint!) (30%)</p>

<p>Creativity of Submission (innovative/originality) (30%)</p>

<p>Business Potential (20%)</p>

<p>Innovative usage of Expedia APIs (20%)</p>

<p>The judging panel will determine the top three (3) Submissions, which will then be designated as potential award recipients.</p>

<p>The potential award recipients will be notified of their selection during the award ceremony at the Event on 26 April 2017 and will be required to sign and provide to Expedia appropriate documents to establish eligibility and compliance with these Terms and Conditions, and such other agreements, forms and releases as may be necessary to give effect to these Terms and Conditions or as may be required by the Expedia Parties. Participants must be present at the award ceremony to be eligible for an award.
