<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

<p>The Expedia Partner Hackathon (the “Challenge”) is sponsored and administered by Expedia, Inc., 333 108th Avenue NE, Bellevue, WA 98004 (“Expedia”). By participating in this Challenge, participants agree to be bound by these Challenge Terms and Conditions as well as all decisions of the judges and Expedia which are final and binding on all aspects of the Challenge.</p>

<p>By participating in this Challenge, you acknowledge and agree that if you share an idea, suggestion, or discuss an application concept that you are working on that Expedia and others may use your idea, suggestion or concept and incorporate into an application that they are working on now or in the future, and you waive any and all claims that you may have against Expedia or anyone participating in this Challenge and Expedia may use or incorporate into an application or other service or product, any idea, suggestion, or concept that you mention.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility</strong>: Challenge is open to legal residents of the fifty (50) United States and the District of Columbia, Asia Pacific, the European Union (“EU”) and North America, 18 years of age or older (or at least the age of majority in their jurisdiction of residence) who are registered attendees of the Expedia Partner Hackathon (“Event”), scheduled to take place at Křižíkova 682/34a Prague, Czech Republic, 186 00 from 14-16 June, 2016 (the “Challenge Period”). Employees, officers and directors of Expedia, their respective successors, participating card partners, client financial institutions, award suppliers and advertising and promotion agencies, and each of their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, officers, directors, shareholders and employees (collectively, “Expedia Parties”), and each of their immediate family members (spouse and parents, children and siblings, and their respective spouses, regardless of where they live) and individuals living in the same households of each of these individuals, whether related or not, of the above are eligible to participate in the Event but are not eligible to win or receive an award. Subject to all applicable laws.</p>

<p><strong>How to Participate:</strong> Participants compete individually or in teams of up to 4 individuals. During the Challenge Period, each individual/team will have the opportunity to hack and build on any of the API’s provided by Expedia via the Challenge website made available at the Event by Expedia (each, a “Submission”). Teams wishing to be considered for the Challenge will be required to complete all relevant Challenge submission forms provided by Expedia. Limit of one (1) Submission per individual/team throughout the Challenge Period.</p>

<p><strong>Judging Criteria:</strong> Submissions will be judged by a panel of external judges (not employed by Expedia) who will review Submissions and select award recipients based upon the following criteria:</p>

<p>Implementation Completeness (working code trumps over fancy PowerPoint!) (30%)</p>

<p>Creativity of Submission (innovative/originality) (30%)</p>

<p>Business Potential (20%)</p>

<p>Innovative usage of Expedia APIs (20%)</p>

<p>The judging panel will determine the top three (3) Submissions, which will then be designated as potential award recipients.</p>

<p>The potential award recipients will be notified of their selection during the award ceremony at the Event on 16 June and will be required to sign and provide to Expedia appropriate documents to establish eligibility and compliance with these Terms and Conditions, and such other agreements, forms and releases as may be necessary to give effect to these Terms and Conditions or as may be required by the Expedia Parties. Participants must be present at the award ceremony to be eligible for an award. Failure of a potential award recipient to respond to award notification at the award ceremony may result in the applicable award being forfeited and award to a runner-up.</p>
