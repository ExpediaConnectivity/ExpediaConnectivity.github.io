<p>The EQC Product, Availability and Rates API (PARR) was designed for any EQC partner that needs to connect to Expedia to read/retrieve the current product configuration (rooms and rates defined), as well as the current rates and availability loaded in the system.</p>
<p>While this API is still supported today, it will soon be retired in favor of the newer Product API, which not only allows to retrieve product information, but also lets partners create or edit product information. For more information, please visit the Product API section of this portal.</p>
<h2 id="product-availability-and-rates-retrieval-request" data-magellan-destination="product-availability-and-rates-retrieval-request">Product, Availability and Rates Retrieval Request</h2>
<p>Through a set of parameters, the PARR API allows EQC partners to either retrieve current product information, or to retrieve current rates and availability data loaded in Expedia system.</p>

<h2 id="error-handling" data-magellan-destination="error-handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>You may experience technical difficulties when developing and trying to connect to Expedia QuickConnect PARR. This section addresses the most common errors and problems that an EQC partner might encounter.</p>
<h3 id="network-system-communication-issues" data-magellan-destination="network-system-communication-issues">Network/System Communication Issues</h3>
<p>There are many different error scenarios related to communication and authentication. Here are the possible scenarios, for any of the supported EQC APIs.</p>
<h4 id="connection-cannot-be-established" data-magellan-destination="connection-cannot-be-established">Connection Cannot Be Established</h4>
<p>For many different reasons, attempting to connect to Expedia QuickConnect might not work. If the problem is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connection timeout (before establishing connection)</li>
<li>Cannot resolve host name</li>
<li>Cannot establish connection</li>
</ul>
<p>Before looking for assistance, the EQC partner should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify the URL used to connect to Expedia QuickConnect and make sure the address starts with https://</li>
<li>Verify the domain name, and make sure that the address you are using is the right one for the environment you are targeting (do not try to send QA information to production, or vice-versa)</li>
<li>If the EQC partner&#39;s system is behind a firewall, make sure that port 443 is opened for connection to Expedia&#39;s production environment (contact Expedia if you don&#39;t know what the URL to the production environment is)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also possible to fail to obtain a connection because Expedia QuickConnect servers cannot accept any more connections than the ones currently established to other EQC partners. In this case, the EQC partner will receive a communication error saying: Connection refused.</p>
<p>When this happens, the EQC partner should simply enter in retry mode.</p>
<h4 id="ssl-certificate-validation-problems" data-magellan-destination="ssl-certificate-validation-problems">SSL Certificate Validation Problems</h4>
<p>EQC partners developing in Java should use version 1.4.2_13 or more recent to avoid issues with certificate signing authorities. If EQC partners prefer to keep using an older version of Java or in-house SSL libraries, they need to import the Entrust CA certificate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Entrust CA common name CN = Entrust.net Certification Authority (2048).</li>
<li>To manually import the Entrust.net Certification Authority (2048) Certificate, download the CA certificate at <a href="https://www.entrust.net/downloads/root_request.cfm">https://www.entrust.net/downloads/root_request.cfm</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="system-errors-retry-recommendation" data-magellan-destination="system-errors-retry-recommendation">System errors retry recommendation</h4>
<p>Whenever Expedia PARR return system errors (error code &gt;= 4000), it is up to the EQC partner to decide what is preferable.</p>
<p>If the EQC partner fails to retrieve product or avail and rate data, for systems where a user is expecting instant results, we suggest an immediate retry strategy (1 instantaneous retry).</p>
<h4 id="-connection-established-no-response" data-magellan-destination="-connection-established-no-response">| Connection Established, No Response</h4>
<p>If the EQC partner&#39;s system manages to establish a connection to Expedia QuickConnect servers, but is not getting a response, the EQC partner should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that the EQC partner&#39;s system is not closing the connection too early. Some retrieval queries can take time, and Expedia will keep the connection active for up to 60 seconds. Therefore, the EQC partner should keep the connection open for at least 60 seconds.</li>
<li>Make sure the content length specified in the HTTPS header corresponds to the actual length of the HTTPS request. If the length specified in the header is actually longer than the message itself, it results in Expedia QuickConnect waiting for bytes that never arrive, and eventually times out.</li>
</ul>
