                                4. <u>API Support; Updates</u>. This Agreement does not entitle you to any support for
                                the APIs. You acknowledge that we may update or modify the APIs (or add APIs) from time
                                to time and at our sole discretion (in each instance, an “<strong>Update</strong>”), and
                                may require you to obtain and use the most recent version(s) within the time period set
                                by us. Updates may adversely affect how your Connection communicates with the APIs. You
                                will make any changes to your Connection that are required for integration as a result
                                of such Update at your sole cost and expense.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                fees or other payments will be due under this Agreement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                6. <u>Content</u>. Except as authorized in writing by Us, you will not edit, modify, or
                                copy, any Content that you access via the APIs. At all times during the term, you will
                                ensure that the accuracy and completeness of any and all Content provided to you by a
                                Property or that you receive from us retains the level of accuracy that such Content had
                                when received by you from us or the applicable Property. If any Content as presented
                                through your Connection is inaccurate or incomplete, then you will correct the
                                inaccuracy or incompleteness as soon as reasonably practicable. “Content” means any and
                                all content, data and information that you provide to or receive from us under this
                                Agreement, including without limitation, rates, availability, lodging descriptions,
                                photographs, and customer Personal Data and Payment Information. You will not use
                                Content you access via the APIs for any purpose other than to perform your obligations
                                under this Agreement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                7. <u>Taxes</u>. You shall be solely responsible for any and all taxes and/or other
                                obligations associated with any amounts paid in connection with this Agreement. Any
                                payments made under this Agreement are inclusive of value added (VAT), goods and
                                services, sales, use, excise, gross receipts, consumption, services and any other

                                on, measured by, or based on gross or net income (collectively “<strong>Transaction
                                Taxes</strong>”). If applicable, you will deliver to us a completed IRS Form W-9, IRS
                                Form W-8BEN-E or IRS Form W-8ECI (“<strong>Tax Documents</strong>”) and you shall
                                promptly notify us of any change in circumstance that impacts the validity of the Tax
                                Documents and you will update them accordingly. You shall provide us with an updated
                                version of the Tax Documents promptly upon request. If you fail to comply with the terms
                                of this section, we will be entitled to deduct and withhold payment due to you under
                                this Agreement and all amounts withheld by us shall be treated as though paid to you.
                            </p>
