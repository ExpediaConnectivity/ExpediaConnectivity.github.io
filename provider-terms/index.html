                                    a security key, or other information for you to access the APIs
                                    (an “<strong>API Key</strong>”), you may not share your API Key with any third party

                                    and Your Connection will comply with all terms and conditions of this Agreement,
                                    your agreement with Expedia’s authorized provider, all applicable laws, rules, and

                                    for any activity that violates applicable laws, rules, and regulations or any terms
                                    and conditions of this Agreement, including any fraudulent, inappropriate, or
                                    potentially harmful behavior. As between you and us, you are responsible for all
                                    acts and omissions of your end users in connection with Your Connection and their
                                    use of the APIs, if any.

                                    and conditions (including as to pricing and availability) that are at least as
                                    favorable as the terms and conditions on which you offer connectivity to the
                                    services of other travel booking services providers. You will provide Your
                                    Connection at service levels equal to or better than the service levels at which you
                                    provide connectivity services for access to the services of other travel booking
                                    services providers with respect to availability, response time, and latency. Without
                                    limiting the foregoing, you will use best efforts to ensure that Your Connection is
                                    available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
                                </li>

                                to time and at our sole discretion (in each instance, an “<strong>Update</strong>”),
                                and may require you to obtain and use the most recent version(s) within the time period
                                set by Expedia. Updates may adversely affect how Your Connection communicates with the
                                APIs. You must make any changes to Your Connection that are required for integration as
                                a result of such Update at your sole cost and expense.
                            </p>

                                    all times during the term, you will ensure that the accuracy and completeness of any
                                    and all Content provided to you by a Property or that you receive from Expedia

                                    Connection is inaccurate or incomplete, then you will correct the inaccuracy or
                                    incompleteness as soon as reasonably practicable. “<strong>Content</strong>” means
                                    any and all content, data and information that you provide to or receive from
                                    Expedia under this Agreement, including without limitation, rates, availability,

                                herein, and/or your licenses under this Agreement, in our sole discretion at any time
                                and for any reason, by providing notice to you or revoking access to the APIs and
                                Expedia Marks. In addition, this Agreement will terminate immediately and automatically

                                survive termination. Termination will not limit any of Expedia’s rights or remedies at
                                law or in equity.

                                exporting, re-exporting, releasing, or otherwise making the APIs available outside the
                                US.

                                The invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any provision herein does not affect
                                any other provision herein or the validity, legality, or enforceability of such
                                provision in any other jurisdiction. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this
                                Agreement. Any failure to act by us with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or
                                others does not constitute a waiver and will not limit our rights with respect to such
                                breach or any subsequent breaches. This Agreement is personal to you and may not be
                                assigned or transferred for any reason whatsoever without our prior written consent and
                                any action or conduct in violation of the foregoing will be void and without effect. We
                                expressly reserve the right to assign this Agreement and to delegate any of its
                                obligations hereunder.
