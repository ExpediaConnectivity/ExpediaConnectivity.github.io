    with the interface
    made available by Expedia to Expedia and lodging suppliers that Expedia has approved in
    writing (“<strong>Properties</strong>”) facilitate the exchange of rates, availability, and other
    property-related information between Expedia and such Properties. You: (a) acknowledge
    that this Agreement does not contain a license or right to access or use the data or

    APIs in any manner or for any purpose that infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise
    violates any intellectual property right or other right of any person, or that violates
    any applicable law; or (f) combine or integrate the APIs with any software, technology,
    services, or materials not authorized by Expedia. In addition, you will not use the APIs
    in connection with or to promote any products, services, or materials that constitute,

        specifications provided to you by Expedia. If we provide you with user credentials,
        a security key, or other information for you to access the APIs
        (an “<strong>API Key</strong>”), you may not share your API Key with any third party
        and must keep your API Key and all log-in information secure and must use the API
        Key as your sole means of accessing the APIs. You are solely responsible for any
        losses associated with the loss or misuse of your API Key. We may revoke your API
        Key at any time.
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type: none !important;">
        (b) <u>Provision of Your Connection</u>. You are solely responsible, at your cost

        regulations, and all guidelines, standards, and requirements that we may make
        available to you from time to time. You agree to monitor the use of Your Connection
        for any activity that violates applicable laws, rules, and regulations or any terms
        and conditions of this Agreement, including any fraudulent, inappropriate, or
        potentially harmful behavior. As between you and us, you are responsible for all
        acts and omissions of your end users in connection with Your Connection and their

        (c) <u>Access and Availability</u>. You will make Your Connection available on terms

        favorable as the terms and conditions on which you offer connectivity to the
        services of other travel booking services providers. You will provide Your
        Connection at service levels equal to or better than the service levels at which you
        provide connectivity services for access to the services of other travel booking
        services providers with respect to availability, response time, and latency. Without
        limiting the foregoing, you will use best efforts to ensure that Your Connection is

    set by Expedia. Updates may adversely affect how Your Connection communicates with the
    APIs. You must make any changes to Your Connection that are required for integration as
    a result of such Update at your sole cost and expense.
</p>
<p>
    5. <u>No Fees</u>. No license fees or other payments will be due under this Agreement in
    exchange for the rights granted under this Agreement.

        all times during the term, you will ensure that the accuracy and completeness of any
        and all Content provided to you by a Property or that you receive from Expedia
        retains the level of accuracy that such Content had when received by you from
        Expedia or the applicable Property. If any Content as presented through Your
        Connection is inaccurate or incomplete, then you will correct the inaccuracy or
        incompleteness as soon as reasonably practicable. “<strong>Content</strong>” means
        any and all content, data and information that you provide to or receive from
        Expedia under this Agreement, including without limitation, rates, availability,

        restrict the possession, knowledge, and use of Confidential Information to each of
        its employees, representatives, and subcontractors who (a) has a need to know the
        Confidential Information and (b) is legally obligated to protect the Confidential
        Information to the same or greater degree as required under this Agreement. You may

        entities with jurisdiction over it, if you: (a) give Expedia prior written notice
        sufficient to allow Expedia to seek a protective order or other remedy; (b) disclose
        only such information as is required by the governmental entity; and (c) use
        commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any

        Confidential Information and prevent further unauthorized use and disclosure.

    commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the APIs and Expedia Marks (including all
    copies thereof) from infringement, misappropriation, theft, misuse, or unauthorized
    access. You will promptly notify us if you become aware of any infringement of any
    intellectual property rights in the APIs and Expedia Marks and will fully cooperate with
    us, in any legal action taken by us to enforce our intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p>
    10. <u>Expedia Marks</u>. Subject to your compliance with all terms and conditions set
    forth in this Agreement, we grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive,
    non-transferable, non-sublicensable license during the term to display Expedia Marks

    otherwise authorized in writing by Expedia. Without limiting the foregoing, Your use of
    the Expedia Marks must comply with the Expedia Trademark Guidelines as provided to you
    from time to time. “<strong>Expedia Marks</strong>” means Expedia’s proprietary
    trademarks, trade names, branding, or logos made available for use in connection with
    the APIs pursuant to this Agreement. You must correct or cease use of the Expedia Marks
    within forty-eight hours
    of notice from us. You will not register, adopt, or use any name or other designation
    that includes all or part of any Expedia Mark, or any term that is confusingly similar

    the Expedia Marks only: (i) in the form provided by Expedia; (ii) for purposes as set
    forth above; and (iii) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. You may not use
    any of the Expedia Marks in connection with the transmission or distribution of

    conflict with Expedia policies, or in any way that disparages or devalues Expedia’s
    reputation or goodwill.

<p>
    11. <u>Disclaimer of Warranties</u>. THE API AND EXPEDIA MARKS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND
    EXPEDIA SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR

</p>
<p>
    12. <u>Indemnification</u>. You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Expedia and
    its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and assigns from and
    against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions,
    judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses, arising
    from or relating to (a) your misuse of the APIs or Expedia Marks; (b) your breach of
    this Agreement; and (c) Your Connection, including any end user’s use thereof. If we
    seek indemnification or defense from you, we will promptly notify you in writing of the
    claim(s) brought against us for which we seek indemnification or defense. We reserve the
    right, at our option and in our sole discretion, to assume full control of the defense
    of claims with legal counsel of our choice. You may not enter into any third-party
    agreement that would, in any manner whatsoever, constitute an admission of fault by us
    or bind us in any manner, without our prior written consent. In the event we assume
    control of the defense of such claim, we will not settle any such claim requiring
    payment from you without your prior written approval.
</p>
<p>
    13. <u>Limitations of Liability</u>. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE
    LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR (A) ANY LOST

    ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE APIS; OR (B) ANY DAMAGES, IN THE
    AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF $100 DOLLARS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE OR WE WERE
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ANY CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR
    RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE BROUGHT WITHIN 2 YEARS AFTER THE OCCURRENCE OF THE
    EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM.

    Agreement (as set forth above) and will continue until terminated as set forth in this
    Section. We may immediately terminate or suspend this Agreement, any rights granted
